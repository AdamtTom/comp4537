=======================================================
Adapted from [MIT’s policy on Academic Integrity](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code).

---

In line with [BCIT’s policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.bcit.ca/judicial-student-conduct/academic-integrity/), here are our expectations regarding collaboration and sharing of work.

[](#collaboration)Collaboration
-------------------------------

[](#@encourage_you_help)We encourage you to help each other with work in this class, but there are limits to what you can do, to ensure that everybody has a good individual learning experience. This section describes those limits.

### [](#individual_work)Individual work

[](#@problem_sets_class)Problem sets in this class are intended to be primarily individual efforts. You are encouraged to discuss approaches with other students but your code and your write-up must be your own.

[](#@you_may_not)**You may not use materials produced as course work by other students, whether in this term or previous terms, nor may you provide work for other students to use.**

[](#@good_help_other)It’s good to help other students. But as a general rule, during the time that you are helping another student, your own solution should not be visible, either to you or to them. Make a habit of closing your code while you’re helping.

[](#@during_code_review)During code review, you will see classmates’ solutions to a problem set. While it is fine to take inspiration from their approach, do not copy their work.

[](#@fine_use_material)It’s fine to use material from external sources like StackOverflow, but only [with proper attribution](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code), and only if the assignment allows it. In particular, if the assignment says “implement _X_,” then you must create your own _X_, not reuse one from an external source.

[](#@also_fine_use)It’s also fine to use any code provided by this semester’s class, readings, or problem sets, without need for attribution. Staff-provided code may not be publicly shared without permission, however, as discussed later in this document.

#### [](#@examples)Examples

1.  [](#@alyssa_ben_sit)Alyssa and Ben sit next to each other with their laptops while working on a problem set. They talk in general terms about different approaches to doing the problem set. They draw diagrams on the whiteboard. When Alyssa discovers a useful class in the Java library, she mentions it to Ben. When Ben finds a StackOverflow answer that helps, he sends the URL to Alyssa. **OK.**
    
    *   [](#@they_type_lines)As they type lines of code, they speak the code aloud to the other person, to make sure both people have the right code. **INAPPROPRIATE.**
        
    *   [](#@tricky_part_problem)In a tricky part of the problem set, Alyssa and Ben look at each other’s screens and compare them so that they can get their code right. **INAPPROPRIATE.**
        
2.  [](#@jerry_already_finished)Jerry already finished the problem set, but his friend Ben is now struggling with a nasty bug. Jerry sits next to Ben, looks at his code, and helps him debug. **OK.**
    
    *   [](#@jerry_opens_his)Jerry opens his own laptop, finds his solution to the problem set, and refers to it while he’s helping Ben correct his code. **INAPPROPRIATE.**
        
3.  [](#@louis_had_three)Louis had three problem sets and two quizzes this week, was away from campus for several days for a track meet, and then got sick. He’s already taken two slack days on the deadline and has made almost no progress on the problem set. Ben feels sorry for Louis and wants to help, so he sits down with Louis and talks with him about how to do the problem set while Louis is working on it. Ben already handed in his own solution, but he doesn’t open his own laptop to look at it while he’s helping Louis. **OK.**
    
    *   [](#@ben_opens_his)Ben opens his laptop and reads his own code while he’s helping Louis. **INAPPROPRIATE.**
        
    *   [](#@ben_now_spent)Ben has by now spent a couple hours with Louis, and Louis still needs help, but Ben really needs to get back to his own work. He puts his code in a Dropbox and shares it with Louis, after Louis promises only to look at it when he really has to. **INAPPROPRIATE.**
        
4.  [](#@john_ellen_both)John and Ellen both worked on their problem sets separately. They exchange their test cases with each other to check their work. **INAPPROPRIATE.** Test cases are part of the material for the problem set, and part of the learning experience of the course. You are copying if you use somebody else’s test cases, even if temporarily.
    

[](#@note_examples_marked)Note that in the examples marked inappropriate above, _both_ people are held responsible for the violation in academic honesty. Copying work, or knowingly making work available for copying, in contravention of this policy is a serious offense that may incur reduced grades, failing the course, and disciplinary action. **Copying, or helping somebody copy, may result in an F on your transcript that you will not be able to drop.**

[](#@policy_applies_all)This policy applies to all coursework that is handed in by an individual: problem sets, reading exercises, nanoquiz makeups, etc.


[](#public_sharing_of_work)No public sharing
--------------------------------------------

[](#@people_often_want)People often want to share their code publicly, e.g., on GitHub, in order to show off a portfolio of code they’ve written to potential employers. Building a portfolio is a great idea, but COMP 4537 is _not_ a good class to use for it, because the problem sets and projects are fixed by the course staff, not chosen by you. Personal projects, hackathons, and IAP contests are much better ways to build up your portfolio.


[](#@keep_mind_work)Keep in mind that when work on a problem set or project is copied, both the provider and the consumer of copied materials are violating academic honesty standards, as described above.
